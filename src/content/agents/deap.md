description: "DEAP is an AI agent in the Computation and Communication Optimisation category. ![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/DEAP/deap.svg?cacheSeconds=86400) - A novel evolutionary computation framework for rapid prototyping and testing of ideas. It seeks to make algorithms explicit and data structures transparent. It works in perfect harmony with parallelisation mechanisms such as multiprocessing and SCOOP."
tech_stack:
  - "Python"
  - "LLM APIs"
problem_solved: "This tool addresses challenges in the computation and communication optimisation domain."
target_audience: "Developers and teams working with computation and communication optimisation automation."
inputs:
  - "User configuration"
  - "API credentials (if required)"
  - "Task parameters"
outputs:
  - "Automated task results"
  - "Status reports"
  - "Generated content or actions"
workflow_steps:
  - "User configures the agent with required parameters"
  - "Agent receives input data or trigger"
  - "Agent processes the request using its core logic"
  - "Agent interacts with external services if needed"
  - "Results are returned to the user"
