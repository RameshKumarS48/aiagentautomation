description: "Triton is an AI agent in the Computation and Communication Optimisation category. ![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/triton-lang/triton.svg?cacheSeconds=86400) - Triton is a language and compiler for writing highly efficient custom Deep-Learning primitives. The aim of Triton is to provide an open-source environment to write fast code at higher productivity than CUDA, but also with higher flexibility than other existing DSLs."
tech_stack:
  - "Python"
  - "LLM APIs"
problem_solved: "This tool addresses challenges in the computation and communication optimisation domain."
target_audience: "Developers and teams working with computation and communication optimisation automation."
inputs:
