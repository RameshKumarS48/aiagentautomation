description: "Many-Shot Jailbreaking is a technique that enables the scaling of harmful examples in long-context windows to jailbreak AI systems. It is a method of testing the security of AI models by providing them with a large number of examples that could potentially exploit vulnerabilities. This technique can help identify and fix security flaws in AI systems."
