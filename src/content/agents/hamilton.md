description: "Hamilton is an AI agent in the Data Pipeline category. ![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/dagworks-inc/hamilton.svg?cacheSeconds=86400) - Hamilton is a micro-orchestration framework for defining dataflows. Runs anywhere python runs (e.g. jupyter, fastAPI, spark, ray, dask). Brings software engineering best practices without you knowing it. Use it to define feature engineering transforms, end-to-end model pipelines, and LLM workflows. It complements macro-orchestration systems (e.g. kedro, luigi, airflow, dbt, etc.) as it replaces the code within those macro tasks. Comes with a self-hostable UI that captures lineage & provenance, execution telemetry & data summaries, and builds a self-populating catalog; usable in development as well as production."
