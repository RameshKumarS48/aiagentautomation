description: "DiffSharp is an AI agent in the NET category. An automatic differentiation (AD) library providing exact and efficient derivatives (gradients, Hessians, Jacobians, directional derivatives, and matrix-free Hessian- and Jacobian-vector products) for machine learning and optimization applications. Operations can be nested to any level, meaning that you can compute exact higher-order derivatives and differentiate functions that are internally making use of differentiation, for applications such as hyperparameter optimization."
